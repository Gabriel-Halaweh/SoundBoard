# Soundboard

**Soundboard** is a Python desktop application built using the Tkinter library. It provides a user-friendly interface for creating and managing a customizable soundboard, allowing you to play sound effects with ease. 

## Key Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Soundboard offers an intuitive and easy-to-navigate interface.

- **Customizable Volume Control**: Adjust the volume for individual sound effects using dedicated volume sliders. You can also control the overall master volume to fine-tune your soundboard's output.

- **Looping Sounds**: Using middle click, toggle looping for specific sound effects, allowing continuous playback when needed.

- **Play and Stop**: Left-click to play a sound, right-click to stop it prematurely (and will untoggle looping). The application provides instant feedback on which sounds are currently playing.

- **Stop All**: Quickly stop all currently playing sounds with the "Stop All" button, ensuring a clean slate when needed.

- **Mouse Wheel Support**: Easily scroll through your soundboard, even if you have a large collection of sound effects, using your mouse wheel.
